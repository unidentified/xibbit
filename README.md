xibbit
======

xibbit is a web based XMPP groupchat client based on Candy Chat. 
It supports password based (symmetric) encryption, basic commands and room administration.

xibbit can be used to add chat to your website (please don't use our demo then but host xibbit yourself) easily without the server load a webchat usually causes. 
Users just need to register for a XMPP account (some servers even allow unregistered joining).

However, with support for encryption and fully web based room configuration and administration, xibbit is also useful concerning privacy: It can be used through Tor without DNS leak problems, and chats can be encrypted on client side.

Planned
=======

* Asymmetrical encryption, so that users can chat "activate encryption" instead of having to share a password
* Support for more commands
* GUI features

Issues
======

The support for mobile browsers is rather new. Please look for bugs and report them - not only concerning smartphone browser support, of course.
