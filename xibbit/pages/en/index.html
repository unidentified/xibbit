				<a class="xmpp webclient" href="http://xmpp.org" target="_blank">XMPP (Jabber)</a> is 
				an instant messaging protocol defining functionality similar to
				for example what ICQ, Skype or Google Talk provide. There
				are a lot of XMPP servers. Most of them allow users to 
				register using the server's homepage, and many of them
				support groupchats as well. 
				<br>
				Many of these XMPP servers allow webaccess (clients that run
				completely on a website), so they can be used without an installed client.

			<p class="xmpp webclient">
				<strong class="xmpp webclient">This homepage works as a 
				XMPP groupchat client</strong>.
				<br>
				It allows you to join groupchats on any kind of
				public XMPP server which supports web access. Just 
				open the <a class="xmpp webclient" href="../../chat.html#?lang=en" target="_blank">login form</a>,
				choose a server from our list or enter your own server
				details, and join one or more chatrooms. Note that you
				need an account at the XMPP server you want to use, i.e. you may open the
				server's homepage in your browser and register if you don't 
				have an account yet.
			</p>
			<p class="xmpp webclient">
				Refer to the <a class="xmpp webclient" href="./faq.html" target="_blank">FAQ</a> for more					
				information on how to use this page, and <a class="xmpp webclient" href="./commands.html"
				target="_blank">the commands overview</a> for commands to use in chat.
			</p>
			<p class="xmpp webclient">
				This page lets you <a class="xmpp webclient" href="./link.html" target="_blank">
				create an autojoin link</a> as well. Specify server details and 
				the rooms to join. Users who click the link will be 
				greeted with a login form.<br>
				You might bookmark or post such links, or integrate them 
				in your website as a link to your chatroom. This makes 
				<strong class="xmpp webclient">adding chat
				to your website</strong> very easy.
			</p>
			<p class="xmpp webclient">
				The XMPP client on this page supports <strong class="xmpp webclient">
				client side encryption</strong>,
				i.e. encrypting the messages in your browser using an encryption
				password, and decrypting other users' messages in the browser
				using this password as well. No one who does not know the
				password - not even the server, as the password is never sent
				anywhere - can read such encrypted messages. However, this only
				works if everyone in the conversation is using the XMPP client
				on this page.

				If you want to <a class="xmpp webclient" href="./xmpp.html" target="_blank">learn
				more about using, registering and administrating a XMPP chatroom</a>,
				you might take a look at our <a class="xmpp webclient" href="./xmpp.html" target="_blank">
				informational page</a>. You can use this client to administrate a 
				XMPP groupchat room.
