				<a class="xmpp webclient" href="xmpp.org" target="_blank">XMPP (Jabber)</a> is 
				an instant messaging protocol (similar to for example
				ICQ, Skype or Google Talk, though more flexible). There
				are a lot of XMPP servers. Most of them allow users to 
				register using the server's homepage, and many of them
				support groupchats as well. 
			</p>
			<p class="xmpp webclient">
				However, if a server supports web access (HTTP bind), you
				don't need to use an installed XMPP client (instant 
				messaging program) to chat. You might as well just include
				a client on another homepage. 
			</p>
			<p class="xmpp webclient">
				<strong class="xmpp webclient">This homepage works as a 
				XMPP groupchat client</strong>.
				<br>
				It allows you to join groupchats on any kind of
				public XMPP server which supports web access. Just 
				open the <a class="xmpp webclient" href="../../chat.html#?lang=en" target="_blank">login form</a>,
				choose a server from our list or enter your own server
				details, and join one or more chatrooms. Note that you
				need an account at the XMPP server you want to use, i.e. you may open the
				server's homepage in your browser and register if you don't 
				have an account yet.
			</p>
			<p class="xmpp webclient">
				This page allows you to <a class="xmpp webclient" href="./link.html" target="_blank">
				create an autojoin link</a> as well. Specify server details and 
				the rooms to join. Users who click the link will be 
				greeted with a login form.<br>
				You might bookmark or post such links, or integrate them 
				in your website as a link to your chatroom. This makes 
				<strong class="xmpp webclient">adding chat
				to your website</strong> very easy.
			</p>
			<p class="xmpp webclient">
				Note that at some servers, 
				unregistered users are allowed to join groupchats as well. You may
				want to create an additional link which allows unregistered  
				users to chat (anonymous login). Such links will provide users
				with a nickname form instead of a login form. Note that
				usually anonymous login only works for rooms which are
				permanently registered or which already have registered
				occupants.
			</p>
			<p class="xmpp webclient">
				The XMPP client on this page supports <strong class="xmpp webclient">
				client side encryption</strong>,
				i.e. encrypting the messages in your browser using an encryption
				password, and decrypting other users' messages in the browser
				using this password as well. No one who does not know the
				password - not even the server, as the password is never sent
				anywhere - can read such encrypted messages. However, this only
				works if everyone in the conversation is using the XMPP client
				on this page.
			</p>

				If you want to <a class="xmpp webclient" href="./xmpp.html" target="_blank">learn
				more about using, registering and administrating a XMPP chatroom</a>,
				you might take a look at our <a class="xmpp webclient" href="./xmpp.html" target="_blank">
				informational page</a>. You can use this client to administrate a 
				XMPP groupchat room.
