			<h2 class="xmpp webclient" id="faq_xmpp">What is XMPP?</h2>
			<p class="xmpp webclient">
				XMPP is a protocol for instant messaging and groupchat
				(MUC - multi user chat) - similar to what
				you know from ICQ, Google Talk or Skype. "Protocol" means that "XMPP" just 
				defines how chat works and what it does (i.e. how messages are sent, what
				functions are there etc.). There are a lot of XMPP servers, i.e. chat servers 
				that work as described for XMPP, and a lot of XMPP clients which allow users
				to chat with others after registering at a server.
			</p>
			<p class="xmpp webclient">
				There are quite a number of public XMPP servers at the moment, 
				and a lot of them allow users to register for free. 
				Many servers support groupchat (not every server supports any possible
				feature). Most servers have a homepage which allows users to register, only a 
				few allow registration via client. 
			</p>
			<p class="xmpp webclient">
				XMPP clients are instant messaging programs which can either be installed on
				a users computer or smartphone, or run on a web page (the latter only works if
				the server supports access via webpages, but a quite a number of servers do). 
				<br>
				XMPP clients are either multimessengers like Pidgin which as well support XMPP,
				or dedicated XMPP clients (like, for example, Psi, some mobile apps, or 
				webbased clients like converseJS or iJab).
			</p>
			<p class="xmpp webclient">
				Users on a XMPP server are identified via a <strong class="xmpp webclient">JID (Jabber ID)</strong>
				 - Jabber is used
				synonymously for XMPP. After registering, you have a JID in the form username@server,
				which you can use to login. The login form on this page takes your JID in username
				fields.
				<br>
				XMPP groupchat rooms are identified via a JID as well - this is in the form of 
				roomname@groupchatserver (most servers have the groupchatserver as a subdomain,
				for example muc.jappix.com for jappix.com).
			</p>
			<h2 class="xmpp webclient" id="faq_website">How does this website work?</h2>
			<p class="xmpp webclient">
				This website works as a <strong class="xmpp webclient">XMPP client for
				groupchats</strong>. It works with any XMPP server which supports XMPP MUC
				(multi user chat) and clients that run on web pages.
			</p>
			<p class="xmpp webclient">
				This page allows you to login and join groupchats using our 
				<a class="xmpp webclient" href="../../chat.html#?lang=en" target="_blank">login form</a>
				(please note that you should enter your JID as username in login forms that
				ask for username and password).
				<br>
				This page as well allows you to create <a class="xmpp webclient" href="./link.html" target="_blank">
				autojoin links</a> which already define the
				server and rooms, so that who clicks the link is greeted with a login form that
				asks for JID and password, or only for a nickname if the link is for unregistered 
				joining (which some servers support).
			</p>
			<p class="xmpp webclient">
				XMPP multiuser chatrooms can be used and administrated via this page.
			</p>
			<h2 class="xmpp webclient" id="faq_muc">How does a XMPP groupchat work?</h2>
			<p class="xmpp webclient">
				XMPP groupchat rooms are created once a (registered) user joins a room that
				doesn't yet exist. This makes the user owner. Such a room exists as long as 
				there are occupants in it, and after everyone left, the room and it's settings
				disappear. <br>
				To <strong class="xmpp webclient">register a room</strong>, the user who joined it and is owner has to configure it and
				make it <strong class="xmpp webclient">persistent</strong>.
			</p>
			<p class="xmpp webclient">
				Users in a room have an <strong class="xmpp webclient">affiliation</strong>
				 as well as a <strong class="xmpp webclient">role</strong>.<br>
				An <strong class="xmpp webclient">affiliation</strong> is permanent - 
				something like owner, admin, member (normal user, who is a "registered" member
				of this room), none (normal user) or outcast (banned). The
				server saves it and it stays as long as the room persists, even if the
				user leaves and joins (with the same or a different nickname). 
				<br> A <strong class="xmpp webclient">role</strong>, on the other hand,
				exists as long as a user is occupant of a room. Roles are those of participant or 
				moderator. If a role is set to none, a user is kicked. Owners and admins are moderator
				by default, while other users can be given moderator role by an owner or admin - this
				is a temporary moderator role, as it is lost when leaving the room.
			</p>
			<p class="xmpp webclient">
				Admins can kick and ban and set users as members (members are normal users
				with a persistent member affiliation to a room). Owners can do the same as admins,
				but also configure the room (register or destroy it, set the maximum number of 
				occupants, set room passwords etc.) and set other users as owners or admins. 
				Temporary moderators can kick users (and set subjects and such, in a lot of rooms,
				any user can).
			</p>
			<p class="xmpp webclient">
				Usually, any user can join a room. However, a room can be 
				<strong class="xmpp webclient">password protected<strong class="xmpp webclient"> or 
				<strong class="xmpp webclient">members only</strong>.
				A password protected room can only be joined by those who have the room password,
				while a members only room can only be joined by people who were set as a member by an
				owner or admin (owners and admins can give users member status using their JID) - owners
				and admins have member status by default.

				informational page</a>.
			</p>
			<h2 class="xmpp webclient" id="faq_commands">What commands can I use?</h2>
			<p class="xmpp webclient">
				The client on this page supports a set of a few simple commands you can 
				use to join and leave rooms, open private chat, list all users in room or
				ignore and unignore a user. 
				<br>
				It supports administrative commands as well.
